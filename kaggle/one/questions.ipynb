    "## Data Cleaning Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Basic Data Exploration**\n",
    "**What you need to do:**\n",

    "- **Check the structure:** \n",
    "  - How many rows and columns does the dataset have?\n",
    "  - What are the column names?\n",
    "  - What data type is each column (integer, float, object/string)?\n",
    "- **Preview the data:**\n",
    "  - What do the first 5 rows look like?\n",
    "  - What do the last 5 rows look like?\n",
    "- **Get basic statistics:**\n",
    "  - What's the average age of students?\n",
    "  - What's the minimum and maximum daily usage hours?\n",
    "  - What's the mean mental health score?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Missing Data Investigation**\n",
    "**What you need to do:**\n",
    "- **Count missing values:** Are there any empty cells (NaN values) in any column?\n",
    "- **Calculate percentages:** What percentage of data is missing in each column?\n",
    "- **Decide what to do:** Should you delete rows with missing data or fill them with something?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Data Type Corrections**\n",
    "**What you need to do:**\n",
    "- **Check current types:** Is \"Age\" stored as a number or text?\n",
    "- **Fix if needed:** Convert text numbers to actual numbers\n",
    "- **Example issues to look for:**\n",
    "  - Are usage hours stored as decimals (float) or whole numbers (int)?\n",
    "  - Are Yes/No columns stored properly?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Duplicate Detection**\n",
    "**What you need to do:**\n",
    "- **Check Student IDs:** Does any student appear twice in the dataset?\n",
    "- **Check entire rows:** Are there any completely identical rows?\n",
    "- **Remove duplicates:** Keep only one copy of each student\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Data Validation**\n",
    "**What you need to do:**\n",
    "- **Check for impossible values:**\n",
    "  - Are there students with negative ages?\n",
    "  - Does anyone use social media more than 24 hours per day?\n",
    "  - Does anyone sleep more than 24 hours or negative hours?\n",
    "  - Are Mental Health Scores between reasonable limits (like 1-10)?\n",
    "- **Fix or flag these errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis Tasks\n",

    "- Which values appear most often in each column?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Platform Analysis**\n",
    "**Specific questions to answer:**\n",
    "- Which social media platform is used by the most students?\n",
    "- How many students use Instagram vs TikTok vs Facebook?\n",
    "- Do students from certain countries prefer specific platforms?\n",
    "- Do male and female students prefer different platforms?\n",
    "- What percentage of students use each platform?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Usage Patterns**\n",
    "**Specific questions to answer:**\n",
    "- Do undergraduate students use social media more than graduate students?\n",
    "- Who uses social media more - males or females?\n",
    "- Do older students use social media less than younger students?\n",
    "- What's the average usage for 18-year-olds vs 24-year-olds?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Academic Impact Analysis**\n",
    "**Specific questions to answer:**\n",
    "- How many students say social media affects their academic performance?\n",
    "- What percentage of all students report academic impact?\n",
    "- Do students who report academic impact actually use social media more hours?\n",
    "- What's the average usage hours for students who say \"Yes\" vs \"No\" to academic impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Sleep and Mental Health Correlations**\n",
    "**Specific questions to answer:**\n",
    "- Do students who use social media more sleep less?\n",
    "- What's the average mental health score for students who sleep 8+ hours vs less than 6 hours?\n",
    "- Do students with higher social media usage have lower mental health scores?\n",
    "- Group students by sleep ranges (0-5 hours, 6-7 hours, 8+ hours) and compare their other metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Country-wise Analysis**\n",
    "**Specific questions to answer:**\n",
    "- Which countries have the most students in this study?\n",

    "- Which country has the highest addiction scores on average?\n",
    "- Are there regional patterns (like Asian countries vs European countries)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Relationship Status Insights**\n",
    "**Specific questions to answer:**\n",

    "\n",
    "### 13. **Create New Variables**\n",
    "**What you need to do:**\n",
    "- **Usage Categories:** \n",
    "  - Create a new column that labels students as:\n",
    "    - \"Light User\" (0-3 hours/day)\n",
    "    - \"Moderate User\" (3-6 hours/day) \n",
    "    - \"Heavy User\" (6+ hours/day)\n",
    "- **Age Groups:**\n",
    "  - Create categories like \"Teens\" (18-19), \"Early 20s\" (20-22), \"Mid 20s\" (23-24)\n",
    "- **Risk Score:**\n",
    "  - Combine high usage + low sleep + low mental health score to create a \"risk\" category\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **Data Quality Report**\n",
    "**What you need to do:**\n",
    "- **Document problems found:** Make a list of all the data issues you discovered\n",

    "- Task 9: \"Of the students who say social media affects their academics, what's their average daily usage?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task should result in specific numbers, charts, or insights that you can clearly state and explain!"
