    "    Definition: Changing, organizing, or preparing data to make it useful and easier to understand.\n",
    "    Goal: To clean, transform, and structure raw data for better usability.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    -> Organizing a Grocery List: Sorting random items into categories like \"Fruits\" or \"Dairy\".\n",
    "    -> Fixing Errors in a Student Record: Correcting missing or wrong grades.\n",

    "A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type: integers, floats, strings, or even Python objects. Each element in the Series has a unique label called an index.\n",
